# LED Neopixel game
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is creating the LED game itself. I used connected a button to the arduino and LED strip, so the game can funciton. Before I connected the wires, I had to get a program to work, in which I took sample code from the internet. After everything connected, the game worked flawlessly. However, the LED strip laying on the table is not visually appeasing, so I would need to install a frame for the strip in the future.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking the LED Neopixel with the Arduino. At first, the lights did turn on as one of the wires of the neopixel did not fit the female end of the wire connecting to the Arduino. Instead of continuously jamming the wire in, I decided to test the gadget without the wire plugged in, and it worked. The neopixel turned on and was glowing with the color green. Now that the lights work, I looked up a tutorial to test the other colors and found that some colors made the lights flicker.
